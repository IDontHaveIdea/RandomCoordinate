# RandomCoordinate

This is a plug-in for **Koikatsu Sunshine** that will select a random outfit for the
**Plain** type when the girl have more than 4 outfits. This is only for the **Plain** type.

There are two options accessed through Configuration Manager:

- Random Coordinates Change Room Only
	- **Enabled**: The random outfit will be selected when the girls are in the hotel and beach changing
rooms.
	- **Disabled**: A random selection will occur at every opportunity the game reloads the character (Start
conversations, Dating events, entering a map, ..., etc).
- Use pajamas in Room
	- **Enable**: Always use pajamas in player room.
	- **Disabled**: Used last random coordinate selected.
