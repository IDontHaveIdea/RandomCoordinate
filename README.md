# RandomCoordinate

This is a plug-in for **Koikatsu Sunshine** that will select a random outfit for the
**Plain** type when the girl have more than 4.

- The random outfit will be selected when the girls are in the hotel and beach changing
rooms.
- It's only for the **Plain** type.
- If in the configuration the option Changing Room Only is disabled there will be a
random selection at every opportunity the game reloads the character (Start
conversations, Dating events, entering a map, ..., etc). The game already does this.
